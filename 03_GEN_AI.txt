Generative AI is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that provides complex deep learning models that generate content that does not already exist but has a very high resemblence with real life data such as audio, video, images, text content. These artificial Intelligence systems are very much different from traditional AI systems which are usually used for solving problems like Classification, Regression, Clustering.

4 main categories of GenAI models:

1. GANs: Generative Adverserial Networks 
2. VAE: Variational AutoEncoders 
3. LLMs: Large Language Models 
4. Diffusion Models 


1. GANs: Generative Adverserial Networks:
These are a class of deep learning models developed by Ian Goodfellow in the year 2014. These models use the fascinating Game Theoretic Approach for generating fake realistic content that does not already exist.
