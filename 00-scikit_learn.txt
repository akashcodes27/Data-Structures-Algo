'''
ACME insurance is an insurance company that offers affordable health insurance to thousands of customers. Lets assume that I am the lead data scientist at ACME insurance. I have been tasked with building an automated system(basically a trained ML-model end-to-end pipeline) which is able to estimate the medical expenditure for the company's new customers. In order to make such an estimation, I am supposed to take following features into consideration such as: age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, children, region of residence.
Estimate that our system generates for each customer will enable us to determine how much insurance to charge from every customer

from urllib.request import urlretrieve

medical_data_url = 'https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv'
urlretrieve(medical_data_url, 'medical_insurance.csv')

//We used urlretrieve function from the urllib.request module. This function we have used for retrieving csv insurance data. In our case, we have the csv dataset hosted on github. BUT heres a critical mistake that many could make. We cannot directly use the github link for retrieveing data. We need to click on a button that says 'RAW". This opens the link that has this csv file hosted. This is the link that we will be using


Remember all these are pandas functions, as are doing exploratory data analysis and manipulation using the pandas library 


successfully imported the dataset
medical_df = pd.read_csv('medical_insurance.csv')
medical_df.head(3)

# So the "charges" column is our output variable(or the variable that we need to predict using a regression model), and all other attributes are going to be used as input variables. We basically use hostorical data to train our model and to find patterns betwee input attributes and the output attribute "charges". We can then use this system to predict charges for new customers.

medical_df.info()   pandas function
the info() gives me the following information: attribute names, their datatypes, null or not-null constraint, total number of rows
Lets understand how the Dtypes look like in scikit learn:



medical_df.describe()
the describe() gives me some basic statistical information about the dataset
describe() is extremely useful as it gives us some information like: mean, std deviation, min, max, 50%, 70%, 25%
By analyzing these metrics we can make a bunch of inferences like: For eg: Lets consider attribute "age"
By observing medical_df, we can infer that maximum age of customer is 64 and minimum age of customer is 18 implying people outside this age range cannot register for the insurance 
If we observe the static metric 75%, it gives us information that holds true for 75% of the data.
"age": 51  (75% of customers are aged 51)
"bmi": 34 (75% of customers have class 1 obesity)
"children": 2 (75% of customers have 2 children)
"charges": 16639 (75% of customers spend 16639$ on their medical bills)
Just like 75%, we can also refer to "mean", 50%, 25%, min, max to draw different inferences 



Now alongside Exploratory Analysis, lets also do some visualization. For the purpose of visualization, we will use sonme libraries like: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns 
import plotly.express as px   #plotly is used to make the chart interactive
%matplotlib inline   #this makes sure charts are rederred in code and not in external popup

We will provide some settings to improve default style and font sizes 
sns.set_style('darkgrid')
matplotlib.rcParams[font.size] = 14 
matplotlib.rcParams[figure.figsize] = (10, 6)
matplotlib.rcParams[figure.facecolor] = #00000000
