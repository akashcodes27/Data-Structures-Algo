'''
ACME insurance is an insurance company that offers affordable health insurance to thousands of customers. Lets assume that I am the lead data scientist at ACME insurance. I have been tasked with building an automated system(basically a trained ML-model end-to-end pipeline) which is able to estimate the medical expenditure for the company's new customers. In order to make such an estimation, I am supposed to take following features into consideration such as: age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, children, region of residence.
Estimate that our system generates for each customer will enable us to determine how much insurance to charge from every customer

from urllib.request import urlretrieve

medical_data_url = 'https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv'
urlretrieve(medical_data_url, 'medical_insurance.csv')

//We used urlretrieve function from the urllib.request module. This function we have used for retrieving csv insurance data. In our case, we have the csv dataset hosted on github. BUT heres a critical mistake that many could make. We cannot directly use the github link for retrieveing data. We need to click on a button that says 'RAW". This opens the link that has this csv file hosted. This is the link that we will be using


successfully imported the dataset
medical_df = pd.read_csv('medical_insurance.csv')
medical_df.head(3)

# So the "charges" column is our output variable(or the variable that we need to predict using a regression model), and all other attributes are going to be used as input variables. We basically use hostorical data to train our model and to find patterns betwee input attributes and the output attribute "charges". We can then use this system to predict charges for new customers.
