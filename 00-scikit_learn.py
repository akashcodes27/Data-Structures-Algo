ACME insurance is an insurance company that offers affordable health insurance to thousands of customers. Lets assume that I am the lead data scientist at ACME insurance. I have been tasked with building an automated system(basically a trained ML-model end-to-end pipeline) which is able to estimate the medical expenditure for the company's new customers. In order to make such an estimation, I am supposed to take following features into consideration such as: age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, children, region of residence.
Estimate that our system generates for each customer will enable us to determine how much insurance to charge from every customer
