Let's break down the slicing operation s[-4:-1] step by step for the string s = "python".

1. Understand the String and Indices
First, let's see the string with both positive and negative indices:

text
Character: p  y  t  h  o  n
Index:     0  1  2  3  4  5   (Positive indices)
Index:    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1   (Negative indices)



→ Front slicing (positive indices):
s = "Python"
s[1:4]    # 'yth'
s[:3]     # 'Pyt'
s[2:]     # 'thon'


→ Back slicing (negative indices):
s = "Python"
s[-4:-1]   # 'tho'
s[-6:-2]   # 'Pyth'



→ Mixed slicing (positive + negative):
s = "Python"
s[1:-1]    # 'ytho'
s[-5:5]    # 'ytho'



For the string s = "python", the slice s[::2] extracts characters with a step size of 2, starting from the beginning to the end. Here's how it works:

Step-by-Step Explanation
Syntax: s[start:stop:step]

start is omitted (defaults to 0)

stop is omitted (defaults to end of string)

step = 2 (select every 2nd character)

Indices and Characters:

text
Index:   0   1   2   3   4   5
Char:    p   y   t   h   o   n
Execution:

Start at 0 ('p')

Next: 0 + 2 = 2 ('t')

Next: 2 + 2 = 4 ('o')

Next: 4 + 2 = 6 (out of bounds, stops)

Result: Characters at indices 0, 2, 4 → 'p', 't', 'o'

Output
python
s = "python"
print(s[::2])  # Output: 'pto'
Key Points
Purpose: Skips every alternate character.

Works for: Any sequence (strings, lists, tuples).

Edge Cases:

If s = "p", returns "p".

If s = "", returns "".






Reverse Version (s[::-2])
To step backward:

python
print(s[::-2])  # Starts from end, step=-2 → 'nhy'
