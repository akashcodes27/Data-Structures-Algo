# Tuple: Tuple is also an orderred collection of items. But tuples are "immutable". We cannot add or remove elements to and from a tuple. Since they are immutable, they are fixed size. Because they are immutable, they are also more performance and memory effeciient. They can also store all different types of data 
# 
# 

# Simple tuple
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print(colors)

# Tuple with mixed data types
person = ("Akash", 23, True)

# Single element tuple (note the comma)
one_item = ("hello",)



# Tuple Unpacking: Exactly the same as prop destructuring in React 
var1, var2, var3 = colors

print(var1)   #prints red
print(var2)   #prints green
print(var3)   #prints blue
