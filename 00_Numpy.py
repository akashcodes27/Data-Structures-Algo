In Pandas, for dealing with structured datasets,  We shall be working with 2 kinds of data structures: 
1. One-Dimensional Data Structure: Series  (Appears like a single column in output screen)
2. Two-Dimensional Data Structure: DataFrame (Appears like a table od rows and columns in output screen)

import pandas as pd 

s1 = pd.Series(["BMW", "Honda", "Audi"])

print(s1)
