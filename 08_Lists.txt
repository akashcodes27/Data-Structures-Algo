Nested Lists
A nested list is simply a list inside another list.
Example:

L = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7]



✅ Accessing elements in nested lists:
L[2]          # [3, 4, [5, 6]]
L[2][0]       # 3
L[2][2]       # [5, 6]
L[2][2][1]    # 6


✅ Negative index with nested:
L[-2][-1][-1]  # 6




✅ Modifying nested lists:
L[2][1] = 40
# L becomes [1, 2, [3, 40, [5, 6]], 7]
